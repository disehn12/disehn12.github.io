		<p>At this moment, somebody is sitting next to me watching this being typed out. Her head is on my arm and it seems like she is going to be going to sleep soon. Shrek is currently playing on the tv and everybody will be getting ready to go to bed very soon.</p>
		<p>After they all go to bed, maybe a game of Torchlight. It seems like you can keep playing that game over and over again. I seem to keep doing side missions more than I do the main story mission.</p>
